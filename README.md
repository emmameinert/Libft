# LIBFT

Libft is my self written std library in #C used for upcoming projects during the Hive curriculum. It contains all kinds of functions from printing, via string manipulation to functions with memory allocation.

## Disclaimer

This is my very first project from my time at Hive. It is a base for a lot of following bigger projects. Learning about the stdlib functions and implementing them myself made me understand and appreciate them better. I use them everyday now and it helped me a lot for coding effecient and short functions later on.
