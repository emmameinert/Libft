# LIBFT

Libft is my self written std library used for upcoming projects during the Hive curriculum. It contains all kinds of functions from printing, via string manipulation to functions with memory allocation.

## Disclaimer

This is my very first project from my time at Hive. It is a base for a lot of following bigger projects. Learning about the stdlib functions and implementing them myself made me understand and appreciate them better. I use them everyday now and it helped me a lot for coding effective small functions later on.
